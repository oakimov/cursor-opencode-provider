# cursor-opencode-provider

Use [Cursor](https://cursor.com) subscription models from [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) by speaking Cursor's Connect-RPC agent protocol.

This project is a custom **AI SDK provider** (`LanguageModelV3`) plus an **OpenCode plugin** that handles authentication and model discovery. Instead of calling a generic chat-completions API, it encodes and decodes Cursor's protobuf agent protocol over HTTP/2 to Cursor's agent backend.

> **Status:** Usable end-to-end in OpenCode (auth, models, streaming, tools). See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Demo

OpenCode driving a Cursor-routed Grok model through this provider:

![OpenCode running a Grok model via cursor-opencode-provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oakimov/cursor-opencode-provider/main/assets/opencode-grok.png)

## Features

- **OpenCode integration** — registers a `cursor` provider with auth hooks and cached model list
- **Authentication** — browser OAuth (PKCE), or API key from [cursor.com/settings](https://cursor.com/settings)
- **Model discovery** — fetches available models from Cursor's API and caches them locally
- **Streaming** — bidirectional Connect-RPC stream for agent runs
- **Tool calls** — maps Cursor exec-server messages to AI SDK tool-call parts; strips OpenCode's `read` XML envelope (`<path>`/`<content>` + `N:` prefixes) before returning content to Cursor so the model cannot echo the wrapper into writes
- **Thinking / reasoning** — surfaces extended-thinking deltas where the model supports it

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (for development and tests)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) with plugin support
- An active Cursor account with API access

## Installation

### From npm (after publish)

Add the package name to OpenCode config. OpenCode installs npm plugins with Bun at startup (cached under `~/.cache/opencode/node_modules/`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["cursor-opencode-provider"],
  "provider": {
    "cursor": {
      "npm": "cursor-opencode-provider",
      "name": "Cursor",
      "models": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Pin a version if you want: `"cursor-opencode-provider@0.2.1"`.

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oakimov/cursor-opencode-provider.git
cd cursor-opencode-provider
bun install
bun run build
```

Point config at the built files with absolute `file://` URLs:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/cursor-opencode-provider/dist/plugin.js"],
  "provider": {
    "cursor": {
      "npm": "file:///absolute/path/to/cursor-opencode-provider/dist/index.js",
      "name": "Cursor",
      "models": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## OpenCode setup

If the `cursor` provider block is omitted, the classic plugin auto-registers it on startup (as **Cursor Integration**) using this package's entry. Model entries come from the local cache, which is filled after auth and again on startup when the cache is empty but credentials remain.

For OpenCode builds that use the Effect/Promise **v2** plugin API (`plugins` field), also load:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["cursor-opencode-provider/plugin/v2"]
}
```

Local clone equivalent: `"file:///absolute/path/to/cursor-opencode-provider/dist/plugin-v2.js"`.

That entry registers the provider via `ctx.aisdk.sdk` / `ctx.aisdk.language`. Keep the classic `plugin` entry for auth.

### Authenticate

```bash
opencode auth login
```

Choose the **cursor** provider, then one of:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cursor account (browser login)** | PKCE OAuth — opens cursor.com to sign in |
| **API key** | Paste a key from [cursor.com/settings](https://cursor.com/settings) (`sk-...`) |

After login, the plugin fetches your available models and writes them to `~/.cache/opencode/cursor-models.json` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opencode/` when set). On later startups, a missing, empty, expired, or old-schema cache is refreshed during config load when Cursor auth is available; an existing stale cache remains usable if refresh fails.

### Paths (XDG)

| Kind | Default | Override |
|------|---------|----------|
| Model / version **cache** | `~/.cache/opencode/` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opencode/` |
| OpenCode **auth** (`auth.json`) | `~/.local/share/opencode/` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/` |
| OpenCode **config** (AGENTS, skills, …) | `~/.config/opencode/` | (config dir helper; not the model cache) |

### Select a model

Pick a model from the cached list (for example `composer-2.5`, `default`, or a Claude/GPT model exposed by your subscription):

```bash
opencode run --model cursor/composer-2.5 "Hello from Cursor via OpenCode"
```

#### Variants

Cursor models often expose parameterized variants (effort, thinking, fast, context tier, …). The plugin materializes those as OpenCode **model variants**. In the TUI, pick one from the variant dialog or cycle with OpenCode’s `variant_cycle` keybind (default `ctrl+t`).

The selected variant’s Cursor parameter map is forwarded on the Run as `requested_model.parameters` (isolated under `providerOptions.cursor.cursorVariantParameters` so unrelated OpenCode options are not leaked onto the wire).

#### 1M / long context

OpenCode’s context limit is static per model entry, while Cursor’s long-context tier is a variant parameter (`context=1m`). When a model has both a base tier and a `1m` tier, the plugin emits a separate OpenCode entry `<model-id>-1m` (for example `claude-opus-4-8-1m`) with:

- `limit.context` set to the 1M window (so overflow checks and compaction match the tier)
- `limit.output` set to `128000` (max generation tokens — not the context window; base entries use `32000`)
- only the long-context variants in its picker
- the real Cursor model id carried in `options.cursorModelId` (not `config.id`, which would make OpenCode merge base variants into the 1M entry)

The Run still uses Cursor’s original model id; OpenCode’s synthetic `-1m` id is only for picking and limits.

#### Max mode

Cursor IDE has a separate **Max Mode** toggle that sets `requested_model.max_mode` and selects the default max / 1m variant. OpenCode has no equivalent custom toggle, so this provider approximates it:

- Selecting a `*-1m` model (or any resolved params with `context=1m`) sets wire `max_mode` to `true`
- An explicit `providerOptions.cursor.maxMode` hint also turns it on

There is no independent Max Mode chrome in OpenCode beyond choosing the 1M model / long-context variant.

## Programmatic usage

```ts
import { createCursor } from "cursor-opencode-provider"

const cursor = createCursor({
  name: "cursor",
  accessToken: process.env.CURSOR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  // apiBaseURL: "https://api2.cursor.sh",
  // agentBaseURL: "https://agentn.us.api5.cursor.sh", // explicit Run host override
  // telemetryEnabled: true, // opt in to GetServerConfig telemetry
})

const model = cursor.languageModel("composer-2.5")
// model implements AI SDK LanguageModelV3 (doStream / doGenerate)
```

Pass either `accessToken` (JWT from OAuth or key exchange) or `apiKey` (raw `sk-...` key). Optional: `apiBaseURL`, `agentBaseURL`, `headers`, `telemetryEnabled`. The older `baseURL` option is still accepted as a legacy alias for `agentBaseURL`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CURSOR_WEBSITE_URL` | Override OAuth login base URL (default `https://cursor.com`) |
| `CURSOR_API_BASE_URL` | Override API base for auth, model discovery, and `GetServerConfig` agent URL resolution (default `https://api2.cursor.sh`) |
| `CURSOR_GET_SERVER_CONFIG_TELEMETRY` | Set to `1` or `true` to opt the `GetServerConfig` lookup into telemetry in OpenCode/plugin usage |
| `CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG` | Set to `1` or `true` to enable wire-level debug logging |
| `CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG_FILE` | Debug log path (default `/tmp/cursor-provider-debug.log`) |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | When set, model/version caches go under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opencode/` instead of `~/.cache/opencode/` |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | When set, OpenCode `auth.json` is read from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/` instead of `~/.local/share/opencode/` |

`createCursor({ agentBaseURL })` overrides the agent Run host. When unset, the provider resolves the host from Cursor's `GetServerConfig` API (`agentUrlConfig.agentnUrl`, region-specific — e.g. `agentn.us.api5.cursor.sh`, `agent-gcpp-uswest.api5.cursor.sh`) once per process and holds it in memory (never written to disk), so a held-open Run stream is never repointed mid-session. Explicit agent overrides and GetServerConfig results are validated as HTTPS `*.cursor.sh` hosts (Cursor's agent hostnames vary and may change); non-`cursor.sh` hosts are rejected. The lookup sends `{ "telem_enabled": false }` by default; set `telemetryEnabled: true` in provider config, or `CURSOR_GET_SERVER_CONFIG_TELEMETRY=1` for OpenCode/plugin usage, to opt in. If the lookup fails or does not return a valid Cursor agent host, the model call fails clearly instead of falling back to `agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh`.

## Development

```bash
bun install          # install dependencies
bun run build        # compile TypeScript → dist/
bun run typecheck    # type-check without emit
bun test             # run unit tests
bun run test:watch   # watch mode
```

## Architecture

```
OpenCode
  └── CursorPlugin (auth, model cache, config hook)
        └── createCursor() → LanguageModelV3
              ├── session.ts  held-open Run stream + exec bridge

```

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `src/plugin.ts` | Classic OpenCode hooks: provider registration, OAuth, API key exchange, token refresh |
| `src/plugin-v2.ts` | OpenCode Effect/Promise v2 plugin (`ctx.aisdk.*`); load via `./plugin/v2` only |
| `src/index.ts` | `createCursor` factory; default export is `CursorPlugin` |
| `src/language-model.ts` | AI SDK `LanguageModelV3` adapter (`doStream`, `doGenerate`) |
| `src/session.ts` | Held-open agent Run session and pending exec correlation |
| `src/debug.ts` | Opt-in wire-level debug logging (`CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG`) |
| `src/auth.ts` | PKCE OAuth, API key exchange, JWT refresh |
| `src/models.ts` | `AvailableModels` fetch and `cursor-models.json` cache |
| `src/agent-url.ts` | `GetServerConfig` fetch + in-process memo (region-specific Run host) |
| `src/transport/connect.ts` | HTTP/2 bidi stream and unary RPC calls |
| `src/protocol/` | Protobuf encode/decode, checksum/device ids, tool-call mapping |

## Package exports

| Import path | Export |
|-------------|--------|
| `cursor-opencode-provider` | `createCursor`, `CursorPlugin` (named + default) |
| `cursor-opencode-provider/plugin` | `CursorPlugin` (classic Hooks — auth) |
| `cursor-opencode-provider/plugin/v2` | OpenCode Effect/Promise v2 plugin (`ctx.aisdk.*`) |

`CursorPluginV2` is **not** re-exported from the package root — the classic plugin loader would treat it as a broken Hooks export. Always load it via `./plugin/v2`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| No Cursor models in the picker | Confirm Cursor auth (`opencode auth login` → **cursor**). Restart OpenCode — if auth is present and the cache is empty, models are fetched on startup. Confirm `provider.cursor.npm` is the package name (or a built `file://…/dist/index.js`). |
| Auth / 401 errors mid-session | Re-login. OAuth and exchanged API-key JWTs refresh automatically when near expiry; a revoked refresh token needs a fresh login. |
| “Too many connections from different devices” | Device IDs are derived from stable OS identifiers (same approach as the Cursor CLI). Avoid running multiple clients that invent different machine fingerprints for the same account. |
| Empty or stale model list | Delete `~/.cache/opencode/cursor-models.json` (or under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opencode/`) and restart OpenCode. Existing Cursor auth is enough to refill the cache; re-login only if auth itself is broken. Cache TTL is 24h; a failed background refresh keeps serving the previous cache. |
| Stream hangs or HTTP/2 errors | Abort the turn and retry. The agent Run uses a bidirectional HTTP/2 stream; a dropped connection leaves the in-flight session unusable. With debug logging enabled, `interaction_query: replied` means a Cursor UI/approval request was answered; a later heartbeat-only stall without that line usually means OpenCode is running an older build and should be restarted after `bun run build`. |
| No response / silent 200 + close | The provider resolves the Run host from `GetServerConfig` (`agentUrlConfig.agentnUrl`). The URL is resolved once per process and not cached on disk. If resolution fails, the model call reports the endpoint-resolution error instead of falling back to `agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh`, which some accounts reject silently ("This region is not yet available for your team"). Set `CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG=1` to confirm the resolved host in the debug log. |
| Need wire-level logs | Set `CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG=1` (optional `CURSOR_PROVIDER_DEBUG_FILE`, default `/tmp/cursor-provider-debug.log`) and reproduce the issue. |

## Known limitations

- **Personal use / ToS** — this provider speaks Cursor’s private agent protocol (CLI-shaped client identity). Use only with an account you own; Cursor may change or restrict the API without notice.
- **`request_context` from OpenCode** — each Run sends Cursor `RequestContext` built from OpenCode project context (workspace env, `AGENTS.md` / `instructions`, `.opencode` agents/skills/plugins, git, layout, plus `.claude`/`.agents` skill fallbacks). Same discovery as OpenCode — including `.cursor/` paths only when listed in `instructions`. Cursor-only cloud/sandbox marketplace surfaces are omitted.
- **Configured MCP tools keep their upstream server id** — OpenCode builtins and plugin/custom tools are advertised under a synthetic `opencode` MCP server. Tools whose flattened name matches an MCP server in merged `opencode.json` configuration (`github_create_pull_request`, …) are grouped into that server's `mcp_descriptors` / `provider_identifier` (`github`, …). Unknown underscore-containing names stay under `opencode` rather than being guessed incorrectly. Exec still reconstructs the full OpenCode tool id.
- **Tool-call display stub** — semantic `tool_call_started` frames are only partially decoded. Tool execution itself goes through the exec channel and works; UI that relied solely on the display type would be incomplete.
- **Cursor-native interactions are headless** — Cursor UI/approval requests cannot be surfaced through the AI SDK provider interface. Web access, questions, mode changes, PR/MCP/image/SCM actions are declined so they stay behind OpenCode's own tools and permissions; plan/environment lifecycle requests receive the same non-interactive acknowledgements used by Cursor's headless client. Unknown future interaction variants fail the turn explicitly instead of hanging the Run stream.
- **Compaction resets Cursor conversation state** — the classic plugin marks OpenCode's `compaction` agent explicitly. On those turns the provider mints a fresh Cursor `conversation_id`, drops the prior checkpoint + KV blobs, preserves real tool-result text in the seed history, and re-advertises the session's last tool catalog while refusing execution during the summary itself. The next normal turn therefore keeps tool availability without inheriting the pre-compaction cache usage. Ordinary no-tool / `toolChoice:none` calls do not reset conversation state.
- **No fallback models** — if Cursor’s `AvailableModels` API is unreachable and there is no local cache, the provider exposes no models.
